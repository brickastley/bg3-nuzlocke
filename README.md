# Baldur's Gate 3 Nuzlocke Ruleset

This is the ruleset that I am currently using for my BG3 Nuzlocke Act 1 playthrough, which is subject to change

# Rules

- The game is played on Honour Mode difficulty.
	- This prevents reloading past saves and forces a run to end on party wipe.
- If a party member dies, they may no longer be used for the rest of the run.
	- If Withers is unlocked at camp, the dead party member must be "held on to" by Withers to remain in a dead state.
	- If Withers is not unlocked, the dead party member must stay dead in the party taking up a slot.
	- Revivify scroll/spell usage or Withers resurrection usage disqualifies the run.
- Because you cannot adventure without your main character, if your main character dies, the run is ended.
- Hirelings are allowed.
- The challenge is complete when you return to camp after all of the following NPCs are killed in battle: 
	- True Soul Gut
	- Minthara
	- Dror Ragzlin
	- Owlbear
	- Auntie Ethel
	- Phase Spider Matriarch
	- Flind
	- Polma
	- True Soul Nere (must be fought in battle, not left to die by timer)
	- Grym
	- Spectator
	- Bulette
	- BOOOAL
	- Bernard 
	- Filro the Forgotten
- Your final score is the number of long rests you have taken; lower scores are better scores, like golf.
